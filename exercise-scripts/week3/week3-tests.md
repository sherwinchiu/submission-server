## Question 1

### Number addition

User will create a function named "sum" that takes two double parameters and adds them. Return the sum.
Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

Use only the **iostream** library.

```
Input: 5, 10
Output: 15

Input: 32.312, 61.12
Output: 93.432
```

## Question 2

### Absolute Value

User will create a function named "abs" that will ask for a number, and if it is negative will give a positive output. If it is positive, the number won't change. Return the absoluted number. It must take in doubles.
Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

Use only the **iostream** library.

```
What is the number? 23
23

What is the number? 34.321
34.321

What is the number? -23
23
```

## Question 3

### Odd or Even

User will create a function that will ask for a number, and determine if the number is odd or even.
Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

```
What is the number? 23
The number is odd.

What is a number? 52
The number is even.

```

## Question 4

### Min and Max

User will create two functions that will take 3 numbers each. One function will give the maximum of the three numbers, and the other function will give the minimum of the three numbers. Have it work with decimal numbers.

After, create two more functions with the same function names as the previous ones. The difference is these functions will take in 4 inputs instead of 3. Again, the function named maximum will give the maximum out of the four numbers. The function named minimum will give the minimum of the four numbers.

Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

```
What is the first number? 32.1
What is the second number? 5.2
What is the third number? -62.1
The lowest number is -62.1
The highest number is 32.1
What is the first number? 100
What is the second number? 53.2
What is the third number? 41.1
What is the fourth number? -72.3
The lowest number is -72.3
The highest number is 100
```

## Question 5

### Area Calculator

Design 3 different functions, one to calculate the area of a rectangle, one to calculate the area of a triangle, and one to calculate the area of a circle. Have a program that repeatedly asks for the shape to calculate the area of. Then, ask for the respective units needed (height and width, base and height, and radius), and output the area of that shape. Keep on repeating until the user types 'Q'. You can use 'R' for square, 'T' for triangle, and 'C' for circle. If an invalid character is inputted, say that it was an incorrect input and ask for another input. Have the area be correct to 2 decimal places.
Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

```
What shape's area do you want to calculate? R
What is the height? 5
What is the width? 5
The area of the rectangle is 25.
What shape's area do you want to calculate? T
What is the height? 5
What is the base? 5
The area of the triangle is 12.5
What shape's area do you want to calculate? C
What is the radius? 5
The area of the circle is 78.54.
What shape's area do you want to calculate? Q

```

## Question 6

### Solving for a Linear Function

Create a function that can solve the x-intercept of a linear equation. The user will input the slope and the intercept of a linear function. Taking this function, figure out where the root of the function is (where it intersects the x-axis). For example, the linear equation of y = 3x + 4 has a solution of -4/3. You can get this by negating the intercept, and then dividing the negative intecept by the slope. This is because you set y = 0, so you get the equation 0 = 3x + 4 and solve for x.
Make sure to have a function declaration and function definition.

```
What is the slope of the function? 3
What is the y-intercept of the function? 4
The x-intercept is at x = -1.3333333

What is the slope of the function? 2.5
What is the y-intercept of the function? 3.3
The x-intercept is at x = -1.32

```

## Question 5

### Solving a Reimann Sum/Dot product

what just solve it

## Question 6

## Solving for a Quadratic Function using Iteration

Create a function that can solve for a single x-intercept of a quadratic equation. The user will input the three co-efficients of a quadratic equation f(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C. Given an x-coordinate,
